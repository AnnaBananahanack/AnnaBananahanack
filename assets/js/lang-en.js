        longDescriptionInfo1: `“From Etta to Lizzo” is a celebration of the power and sensitivity of iconic female voices—from Etta James to Lizzo, with stops along the way at Dusty Springfield, Joss Stone, Beyoncé, and the legendary girl groups of the 1950s.

Up to two hours of live music and nine musicians on stage—each with a solid background and experience in renowned national acts—bring these songs to life through reinterpretations full of soul, energy, and personality. The band, featuring a rhythm section, horns, and backing vocalists, delivers a rich, powerful sound with attention to every detail—one that moves and captivates from the very first note.

To enhance the visual impact and capture the authentic spirit of R&B, the show also features up to four dancers who perform during the most high-energy songs, blending music and movement in true American style.

“From Etta to Lizzo” is also a nostalgic journey. The songs featured in the show have been part of key moments in many people’s lives: they bring back memories of childhood, adolescence, and personal stories. Each song is a bridge to a feeling, a time, a memory.

That same nostalgia is present in the show’s format: powerful lead vocals, live musicians, dancers… a stage production that recalls the golden age of music shows, when performances were meant to be felt with all the senses.

At the heart of the project is Anna, a versatile vocalist with a deeply expressive performance style. Her classical music training and experience as both singer and instrumentalist come together with a strong emotional connection to soul and R&B—born from a lifelong admiration for the great Black American voices. This influence shines through in every performance, where emotion and stage presence merge into a vibrant experience.

“From Etta to Lizzo” is more than a concert, it's a celebration of soul, rhythm, and the power of women in music. A show created to move, inspire, and leave a lasting impression.`,
